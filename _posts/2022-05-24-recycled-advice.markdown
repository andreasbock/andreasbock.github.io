# Recycled Advice

Sometimes, advice is nice. Here's a collection of things I have to remind myself of
from time to time.

_This page is under constant improvement_

## Career

* [Some Career Advice for Postdocs and Grad Students](https://math.ou.edu/~kmartin/career-ad.html)
* [Tao's Advice](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/)

Checklist (from [MathOverflow](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/294919/how-can-a-mathematician-handle-the-pressure-to-discover-something-new)
and [academia.stackexchange](https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/89032/how-to-stop-hopping-the-learning-chain-and-actually-begin-somewhere)): 

* Don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good
* Talk math with your colleagues
	* Never eat lunch alone
* Give talks or lectures  (when is the last time?):
	* about things you've learnt
	* about a topic you in which you have a background

## Miscellaneous

* Matt Might has some great posts, one of which is on [tips and tricks for grad students and academics](https://matt.might.net/articles/productivity-tips-hints-hacks-tricks-for-grad-students-academics/)


## Reading

Ask yourself:

* what question does this paper seek to answer?
* what is the answer?
* what reasons does the author give for that answer?

Breadth vs depth?
